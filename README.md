# pixycam_object_tracking

## Project Description
This project involves integrating a Pixy camera with a robotic platform implemented from scratch using the STM32F103 MCU that will be interfaced with the Parallax Propeller board for sensor integration (obstacle avoidance). The primary objective is to enable the robot to autonomously track and follow a colored object based on the image data received from the Pixy camera. 

##Branches
This project is organized into two branches:
- stm32: Contains all the code and documentation related to the STM32 microcontroller.
- propeller: Contains all the code and documentation related to the Parallax Propeller board.
